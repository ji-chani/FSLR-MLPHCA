## Abstract
Deaf or hearing-impaired individuals have long been faced with problems in communicating 
with the normal hearing population. To cope with this communication gap, numerous sign 
languages have been developed, one of which is the Filipino Sign Language (FSL). Despite 
FSL being declared as the national sign language of the Philippines, most Filipinos still do not 
understand the language. Sign interpreters play a crucial role in this limitation but are still 
insufficient. Hence, machine learning techniques are leveraged to automate the interpretation 
process of signed gestures and the field of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) is developed. 
This paper extends this field by utilizing computational topology-based methods in performing 
Filipino Sign Language Recognition (FSLR). Specifically, it aims to utilize Persistent 
Homology Classification Algorithm (PHCA) in classifying or interpreting dynamic FSL 
gestures. Due to many distinct classes considered in this problem, this paper also aims to 
develop the multi-level PHCA in which this approach divides the classification task. It does so 
by defining categories consisting of classes and performing two-part classification, first on the 
categories, and second on the classes within the selected category. The performance of PHCA 
and multi-level PHCA using different classification metrics is evaluated. The study shows that 
both PHCA and multi-level PHCA produced satisfactory results for FSLR. It is shown further 
that multi-level PHCA outperformed PHCA in all setups considered in this paper, indicating a 
potential for further research.
